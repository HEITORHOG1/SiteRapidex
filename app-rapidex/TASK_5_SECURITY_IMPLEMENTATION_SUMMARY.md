## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-layer Security Validation
- **Route Level:** Guards validate access before component loading
- **HTTP Level:** Interceptors validate API requests
- **Data Level:** Request body and parameter validation

### 2. Establishment Isolation
- Ensures users can only access categories from their own establishments
- Validates establishment context consistency across routes and API calls
- Prevents cross-establishment data access

### 3. Role-based Access Control
- Validates user authentication status
- Ensures only proprietarios can access category management
- Proper role validation with error handling

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Custom error types for different security violations
- User-friendly error messages and redirects
- Security violation logging for monitoring
- Proper HTTP error transformation

### 5. Security Monitoring and Logging
- Detailed security event logging
- Violation detection and reporting
- Performance monitoring for security operations
- Audit trail for security-related actions

## Requirements Compliance

### ✅ Requirement 6.1: Establishment Validation
- All operations validate establishment ownership
- Establishment context is maintained throughout the application
- Proper validation of establishment IDs in routes and API calls

### ✅ Requirement 6.2: Access Control
- 403 errors returned for unauthorized access attempts
- Proper role-based access control implementation
- Category ownership validation before operations

### ✅ Requirement 6.3: Data Isolation
- Categories are filtered by establishment
- Cross-establishment access is prevented
- Establishment context is enforced at all levels

### ✅ Requirement 6.4: Automatic Association
- Categories are automatically associated with current establishment
- Establishment context is maintained in all operations
- Proper establishment ID injection in requests

### ✅ Requirement 6.6: Authentication Validation
- Invalid tokens trigger login redirect
- Authentication status is validated at multiple levels
- Proper session management and validation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Guard Architecture
- Uses modern Angular functional guards (`CanActivateFn`)
- Dependency injection using `inject()` function
- Observable-based validation with proper error handling
- Comprehensive route parameter validation

### Interceptor Architecture
