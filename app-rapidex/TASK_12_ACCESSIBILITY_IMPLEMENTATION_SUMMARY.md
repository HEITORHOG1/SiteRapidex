### 2. ARIA Labels and Roles

#### Semantic Structure
- **Region Roles**: Main selector container marked as `role="region"`

  - `role="grid"` on container
  - `role="gridcell"` on each card
  - `aria-rowcount` and `aria-colcount` attributes
  - `aria-rowindex` and `aria-colindex` for each cell

#### Descriptive Labels
- **Comprehensive aria-label**: Cards include establishment name, status, address, phone
- **Context Instructions**: Screen reader instructions for keyboard navigation
- **Status Announcements**: Live regions for loading, error, and selection states

#### Interactive Elements
- **Button States**: `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons
- **Selection State**: `aria-selected` for establishment cards
- **Describedby Relationships**: Links cards to their descriptive content

### 3. Focus Management and Visual Indicators

#### Focus Indicators
- **Enhanced Focus Styles**: High-contrast focus outlines with proper offset
- **Focus Visible**: Support for `:focus-visible` pseudo-class
- **Focus Trapping**: Modal focus management for establishment selector overlay

#### Visual Feedback
- **Focus Pulse Animation**: Subtle animation for focused elements
- **Selection Indicators**: SVG-based checkmark with proper ARIA attributes
- **State Changes**: Visual feedback for hover, focus, and selection states

### 4. Screen Reader Compatibility

#### Screen Reader Only Content
- **Context Labels**: Hidden labels for form fields and interactive elements
- **Status Information**: Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- **Descriptive Text**: Additional context for complex interactions

#### Live Regions
- **Polite Announcements**: Non-critical updates (loading, selection)
- **Assertive Announcements**: Critical errors and alerts
- **Status Updates**: Real-time feedback for user actions

#### Semantic HTML
- **Proper Headings**: Hierarchical heading structure
- **Form Labels**: Associated labels for all form controls
- **Button vs Link**: Appropriate element selection for interactions

### 5. Enhanced Components

#### Dashboard Component
- **Navigation Menu**: ARIA menubar pattern with proper roles
- **Search Functionality**: Labeled search input with proper associations
- **Notification System**: Accessible notification button with badge count
- **Modal Dialogs**: Proper modal ARIA attributes and focus management

#### Login Component
- **Form Accessibility**: Enhanced with proper labels and error associations
- **Password Toggle**: Accessible show/hide password functionality
- **Error Handling**: ARIA live regions for form validation errors

### 6. CSS Accessibility Features

#### Responsive Design
- **High Contrast Support**: `@media (prefers-contrast: high)` queries
- **Reduced Motion**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` support
- **Focus Management**: Consistent focus styles across components

#### Utility Classes
- **Screen Reader Only**: `.sr-only` class for hidden content
- **Skip Links**: Navigation skip links for keyboard users
- **Focus Utilities**: Helper classes for focus management

## Testing Implementation

### Accessibility Test Suites
Created comprehensive test files:
- `estabelecimento-selector.accessibility.spec.ts`
- `estabelecimento-card.accessibility.spec.ts`

#### Test Coverage
- **ARIA Attributes**: Verification of all ARIA labels, roles, and properties
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Testing of all keyboard interactions
- **Focus Management**: Focus state and tabindex verification
- **Screen Reader Support**: Content accessibility and announcements
- **Error States**: Accessibility of error and loading states
